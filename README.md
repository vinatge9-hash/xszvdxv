niyantri — Coffee Website

Overview
- A small, modern coffee website with Home, Menu, About, and Contact pages.
- Built using Tailwind CSS classes directly in HTML (via the Tailwind CDN).
- Color palette: espresso (#4b2e2b), crema (#f3e6d8), sage (#9aaea3), teal (#278d89).
- Modern, bold tone with placeholder copy and image placeholders.

Files
- index.html — Home / hero / features / CTA
- menu.html — Menu items with sample prices and images
- about.html — Brand story and imagery
- contact.html — Visit info and a contact form (non-submitting placeholder)

Notes
- Each HTML file includes a top-line comment to indicate the chosen Google font:
  <!-- {{font: Poppins}} -->
- The pages use responsive, full-width (w-full) layouts — there are no fixed-width containers so main content stretches to the browser edges and scales across devices.
- Images are placeholders using the format: src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1662133700210-443c06b47075?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w3ODkyNDZ8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw2fHxkZXNjcmlwdGlvbnxlbnwwfDB8fHwxNzU2MzY1MzQxfDA&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=80&w=1080". Replace with real image URLs or assets as needed.
- Tailwind is configured via the CDN with a small inline tailwind.config to define colors and font family.

How to view
1. Save the files to a folder.
2. Open the HTML files in your browser (start with index.html).
3. Replace placeholder images and adjust copy as desired.

If you want:
- Real images added (I can insert Unsplash links or provide images based on your direction).
- Additional pages (shop, events) or functionality (cart, newsletter integration).
- A production-ready build (extracted CSS, asset pipeline), I can generate a version prepared for deployment.
